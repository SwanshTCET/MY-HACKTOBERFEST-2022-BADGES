# MY-HACKTOBERFEST-2022-BADGES
I participated in The Hacktoberfest 2022, and finally on 31 october my pull requests were accepted and I have been awarded Participation Badges with Level 1,2,3,and level 4 badges for contributing in opensource.
Here are my learnings - 
1) As it was my first time to be a part of hactoberfest, I really enjoyed and got a clear idea of opensource i.e Open-Source Software is a type of software whose code is publicly available to use and modify. Open-Source Contribution involves contributing to the development or improvement of open-source software.
2) Starting from registration process till receiving the Badges it was a great journey, and my seniors of my college helped my alot.
3) I learned to use Github and understood some terminologies like fork, pull request, repositories and how to edit and create new repos.
